# cv
- This is the source of my CV, written in Latex. There is a German and an English version available. I decided to commit everything including binary files, because this seems to me more practical for this kind of project.

- The GPLv3 is meant only for the source code itself. All binary data (Pictures of myself, wordcloud generator, and so on) are and/or might be more restricted and not to be redistributed and/or modified.

- Also, of course, the content itself is not to be used for your application since it is my life and my experience. So please modify this document befor applying for jobs! ;)

- If in doubt, drop me a line!!
